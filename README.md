Kydra is a lightweight, terminal-based personal text vault designed to let users store and manage text entries using keywords, protected by a username and password system. All data is stored locally on the user’s own device, and no information is transmitted or shared. The application supports user registration and login, password hashing, keyword-based text storage, editable entries, and per-user data separation, and it can optionally be compiled into a Windows executable using PyInstaller. Kydra is intended as an educational open-source project focused on privacy, simplicity, and offline use. User credentials are stored in a local file with hashed passwords, and each user has a separate data file for their stored text. This project is not designed for high-security or sensitive data storage and does not implement encryption by default, but it provides a foundation for learning about authentication, file handling, and basic security concepts in Python. Kydra is released as open source under the MIT License, allowing others to use, modify, and distribute it freely for learning and personal projects.
